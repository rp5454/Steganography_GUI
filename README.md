## Pathak-Murari Steganography GUI

Pathak-Murari Steganography is a software application designed for the robust and user-friendly embedding of secret information within image files. Developed in Python, the program caters to individuals and organizations requiring a secure and convenient means for data concealment. This document formalizes the program's functionality, technical specifications, and intended applications.

**Key Features:**

* **Intuitive Interface:** A user-friendly interface minimizes the complexity of data embedding and extraction, enabling seamless operation for users of all technical backgrounds.
* **Image Compatibility:** Supports a wide range of commonly used image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and JPG, offering users flexibility in their choice of carrier media.
* **Robust Algorithm:** Employs a sophisticated data embedding algorithm that minimizes image distortion while ensuring the integrity and recoverability of hidden information.
* **Detailed Information:** Provides users with comprehensive details about the original and steganographically-modified images, allowing for informed decision-making and monitoring of data embedding impact.

**Functionalities:**

* **Data Embedding:** Users can select an image and input their desired secret message, which is then seamlessly embedded within the image's least significant bits.
* **Data Extraction:** Hidden information can be extracted from a steganographically-modified image, revealing the concealed message to authorized recipients.
* **Technical Specifications:**
    * Programming Language: Python
    * Supported Libraries: tkinter, PIL, tkinter.filedialog
    * Image Formats: PNG, JPEG, JPG

**Applications:**
